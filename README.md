# Marvel Heroes

Built with the [Marvel Comics API](https://developer.marvel.com/docs).

Take-home assignment for **Media Monks BA**.

I've picked Angular as my framework of choice due to its advantages for building Single Page Applications and working with long-running streams of events.  It provides a fair amount of out-of-the-box solutions such as routing, two-way data binding, code-splitting, lazy-loading and so on.
The goal was to create an app-like experience that features a simple and friendly UI. This was my first time working with this framework in a while (and my first time ever with Angular Material fwiw) so I wanted to make sure to follow best practices by creating a scalable and robust project structure, even if it might seem to be a bit of an overkill for a small-sized application like this.
It's a little far from what I would've liked to accomplish but I'm pretty happy with the results, specially considering that I haven't used any third-party libraries outside of the UI components.

Thanks for reading!

## TO-DOs due to time constraints

- [ ] HTTP response caching strategy - shareReplay(), take()
- [ ] Splash screen loader for better UX
- [ ] Refactor conditional rendering in order to avoid FOUCs
- [ ] Add more transitions and animations for a richer SPA experience
- [ ] Filter character list by "Favorite" status

- [ ] Componentize the Character module a bit further
- [ ] Get rid of unused code and clean any remaining smells/hacks/inconsistencies
- [ ] Improve a11y and keyboard navigation according to WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Implement BEM correctly (don't judge me)
